# ImplantCommunicator

Quick and simple implementation of how to communicate with NFC type A implants from Android. Made for Ã–redev 2015

## Getting started
- Clone this repository branch
- Have a look at the master branch for a good starting point to test out NFC type A reading
- Check out [branch ```read-implant-and-act```](https://github.com/Franzaine/ImplantCommunicator/tree/read-implant-and-act) to test a working example that can read and print the ID of an implant.
- Have a look at [this Pull Request](https://github.com/Franzaine/ImplantCommunicator/pull/1) to see the very small diff that is needed for implementing the NFC reading.
